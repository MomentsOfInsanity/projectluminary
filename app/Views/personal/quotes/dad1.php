                    Also he writes everything in caps. I will also type the same in caps and post the pictues of the books later. Maybe one day i'll
                    get these pages translated. It is a mixture of non-english and english pages.</p>

                <p><b>Update:</b> It's interesting to see my dads process to life. "The 5 Step Plan". 
                He entered America, he survived in a place thats difficult to survive for immigrants. He didnt get citizenship but he did get legalized.
                I just noticed he wrote survive in america twice. Man did some extra surviving lol. FIannly succeed... I don't think he ever saw himself as succeeding
                but I think he did great for what he had against him. He was a great manager for Raagini. My mom and me succeeded where he couldn't for the opportunities he gave my mom, 
                who was able to become strong and give me my opportunity to succeed.</p>

                <p><u>FOOTPRINTS</u> <br>
                One night a man had a dream. He dreamed he was walking along the beach with the LORD. Across the sky flashed 
                scenes from his life. For each scene, he noticed two sets of footprints in the sand: one belonging to him,
                and the other to the LORD.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the last scene of his life flashed before him, he looked back at the footprints in the sand. He noticed
                    that many times along the path of his life there was only one set of footprints. He also noticed that it
                    happened at the very lowest and saddest times in his life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This really bothered him and he questioned the LORD about it: "LORD, you said that once I decided to follow
                    you, you'd walk with me all the way. But I have noticed that during the most troublesome times in my life,
                    there is only one set of footprints. I don't understand why when I needed you most you would leave me."
                </p>
                <p>
                    The LORD replied: "My son, my precious child, I love you and I would never leave you. During your times of
                    trial and suffering, when you see only one set of footprints, it was then that I carried you."

                    CULTURE IS TOO OFTEN DESTINY. IT ESTABLISHES A PERSON'S DESIRES, VALUES, BELIEF SYSTEM AND CONDUCT. 
                    THEREFORE, IT IS NOT TOO FAR-FETCHED TO BELIEVE IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO DETERMINE ONE'S DESTINY. A PERSON'S DESIRES GOVERN ONE'S DETERMINATION,
                    WHICH REFLECT IN ONE'S DEEDS, AND IT IS ONE'S DEEDS THAT GOVERN ONE'S DESTINY. I CALL IT THE FOUR D's -> DESIRE, DETERMINATION, DEEDS AND DESTINY.
                    SO LEARN THE STRENGTHS OF INDIAN AND AMERICAN CULTURES. BUT ALSO AVOID THE WEAKNESSES OF INDIAN AND AMERICAN CULTURES!!

                    Money is the medium by which earthly success is measured. <br>
                    Money makes possible the enjoyment of the best earth affords. <br>
                    Money is plentiful for those who understand the simple laws which govern its acquisition. <br>
                    Money is governed today by the same laws which controlled it when properous men run the streets of Babylon, six thousand years ago...

                    "A part of all I earn is mine to keep." <br>
                    Say it in the morning when you first arise. Say it at noon. Say it at night. Say it each hour of every day. Say it to yourself until the words stand out like letters of fire across the sky. <br>
                    Impress yourself with the idea. Fill yourself with the thought. Then take whatever portion seems wise. Let it not be not less thanone and lay it by. Avenge your other expenditures to do this if necessary. But by that portion first. Soon you will reduce
                    what a feeling it is to own a treasure upon which you alone have claim. As it grows it will stimulate you. A new joy of life will thank you. Greater efforts will come to you to earn more. For of your increased earnings, will not the same percentage be also yours to keep? <br>
                    Then learn to make your treasure work for you. Make it your slave. Make its children and its children's children work for you.

                    GENERAL DESIRES ARE BUT WEAK LONGINGS. FOR A MAN TO WISH TO BE RICH IS OF LITTLE PURPOSE. FOR A MAN TO DESIRE FIVE PIECES OF GOLD IS A TANGIBLE DESIRE WHICH HE CAN PRESS TO FULFILLMENT. AFTER HE HAS BACKED HIS DESIRE FOR FIVE PIECES OF GOLD
                     WITH STRENGTH OF PURPOSE TO SECURE IT, NEXT HE CAN FIND SIMILAR WAYS TO OBTAIN TEN PIECES AND THEN TWNTY PIECES AND LATER A THOUSAND PIECES AND, BEHOLD, HE HAS BECOME WEALTHY.
                     IN LEARNING TO SECURE HIS ONE DEFINITE SMALL DESIRE, HE HATH TRAINED HIMSELF TO SECURE A LARGER ONE. THIS IS THE PROCESS BY WHICH WEALTH IS ACCUMULATED : FIRST IN SMALL SUMS, THEN IN LARGER ONES AS A MAN LEARNS AND BECOMES MORE CAPABLE!! <br>
