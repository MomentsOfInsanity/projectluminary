                <h3>Oily Foods and Making Videos</h3>
                <p class="title">Good eats</p>
                <p>
                    Today was a interesting day. I tried to cut back on chores today due to being sore yesterday. I did some light stuff. Today was a day of good food. <br>
                    In the morning my mom made Chole and Puri. I had 3 puris with the chole. For the evening, my mom made Pakodas. We made paneer, onion, chili and bread pakodas.
                    I wasn't too much of a fan of chile pakodas but the onion paneer and bread pakodas slapped. The bread pakodas was made with taking leftover aloo stuffing into a sandwich and 
                    coating the bread and frying it. I was in food heaven today. I never liked pakodas growing up but I have grown to like it of recent years. Especially after my last trip to India.
                    <br> However I feel my mom still makes the batter a bit thick and floury. Need to figure out how to have the same crisp but less thickness. Because of the thickness, if 
                    it is not eaten fresh it can get soggy afterwards. 
                </p>
                <p class="title">Pokemon Fever</p>
                <p>
                    As mentioned from my Saturday post I have started recording again. I am playing Pokemon XD: Gale of Darkness. I am trying to complete a challenge by the date of April 8th. But more realistically April 1st as I need a buffer. <br>
                    The challenge is pretty simple. On April 8th, is when Pokemon will shut down online services for several 3ds games and soon after Pokemon Bank. Pokemon has the unique
                    ability to transfer all your pokemon from older games to the newer games. So theoretically I can transfer pokemon from gen 3 to the current games. They have gen 1-2 as virtual games,
                    but as gen 3 games have remaster versions and the fact I never played original gen 1-2 for example Red, but played FireRed I decided to do it this way. <br>
                    The games I will be playing for the challenge are Pokemon Colosseum which is already completed, Pokemon XD: Gale of Darkness, Pokemon FireRed,
                    Pokemon Emerald, Pokemon Platinum, Pokemon Heartgold, Pokemon Black, Pokemon Black 2, Pokemon X or Y, Pokemon Alpha Sapphire, Pokemon Sun, and Pokemon Ultra Moon. <br>
                    Yea. I know it's a lot. I only have 2 months. I should have started atleast the first 4 games earlier. It is not the easiest to get moving and do. With a hard deadline its now or never.
                    I want to be able to play these games and transfer all my friends up to the modern games. While I can still have them on the older games. It would be so cool for everything I have collected.
                    <br><br>
                    Paragraph aside, I spent a bit of time trying to figure out how to stream and record. The last time I did this I wasnt able to do things properly. With a bit more research,
                    I reset OBS and start again. I got a good setup going this time. I feel more motivated to record and stream now then ever. Just have to keep up with the deadline. I finished upto episode 6.

                <p class="title">Chores, Movies and Games</p>
                <p>
                    Saturday morning. As typical with most of my Saturdays, it begins with doing chores due to me being busy over the week. <br>
                    I threw all the pots from the backyard, as well as the table and any broken stuff. I also blew the backyard parking lot with a leaf blower to make it look neat. 
                    I also did the dishes and the laundry. There was few other things I did but I can't remember now. This was my day throughout. <br><br>
                    For breakfast/lunch my mom made Aloo Parathas. I had 2 of them. They were delicious. I also had a cup of chai. Aloo Parathas are one of my favoite dishes. While we ate, 
                    we started a movie called Udaan. Honestly it was pretty good. It wasn't a typical bollywood movie. It was more of a drama. I liked it. <br><br>
                    In the night, I had cleaned up my room and started the setup for recording my games once again. I had gotten it mostly right but was having some minor issues with it. 
                    The game sound was not coming out of my headphones which it usually did. I eventually figured out it had to do with the mic not being assigned so my bluetooth headphones kept
                    tripping up OBS due to it being a mic and headphone 2 in 1 but OBS can only recognize one at a time. I played for a brief time only finishing the first episode.

                    Another normal day at work today. I finished building another feature into iBlocks Online. This allows district and school admins to be used as teachers. It may not make sense but it was a pretty cool thing. <br>
                    After work, I went home for a short bit, then went to Glenns. We celebrated Tori's birthday with some cake. After the birthday, Joe had come and along with Tori and her boyfriend we went bowling. Unfortunately what 
                    none of us realized was that it was league night so we waited in the car for a bit and another bit longer at the bar. I got a drink cocktail. Honestly I didn't like it. Glenn ordered a beer, but he got lucky and got a double because they
                    didn't have the smaller glasses available. Due to the time, I however had to leave early and could not bowl. I went home and knocked out. I was so tired. Working takes a lot out of me.

                    Today was a normal day at work. Though I think I made my boss happy as he gave me a $50 amazon gift card as a bonus. I used the gift card to buy 5 more naruto mangas. <br>
                    I realized I have not bought any of my naruto manga. It has either been given as a gift or bought through gift cards that I got from work. Yes it is buying something but its practically free money.
                    <br><br>
                    After work, as per usual I picked up the yogurt for Glenns Mom. I went home and watched The Bear. I had finished Season 1. It's a really good show. Glenn offered to buy me naruto manga if i do more exercise. That would be so funny but considering it. I need to get back into shape.

                    Once again it's a Monday. Another day of work. I figured I would do something nicer today and dress up more better for work. I felt good about myself. It is a lot of effort though to wake up in the morning to iron clothes.
                    Maybe I should do this at night and have the clothes ready. For lunch I went to Just Salads and got a spinach bowl with raisans, picklen onions, roasted corn, and crotons. As my protein i chose the impossible chicken. It's 
                    not bad but does have weird text intially. <br><br>
                    For the evening, Glenn was not happy with peruvian food and wanted a redemption so we got thai food. This time I got the Tofu Drunken Noodles Extra Spicy. We went to a place Phill recommended. It tastes good,
                    but I wanted more noodles then vegetables. I played some no man sky at home and that was pretty much my day.

                <p class="title">The hunt for flavors.</p>
                <p>
                    Today was mostly a day dedicated to chores. I did the dishes, and grocery. However, through the day I was having one of those mood cravings to cook. It is all I will think about all day.
                    A specific thing actually, Cheesy Garlic Bread. My Cholestrol is screaming but I must have it. I made Garlic Bread before, many times but never like this. Instead of mashing garlic and butter together, I wanted to elevate the garlic.
                    <br> I had put several garlic cloves with a covering of olive oil and put that in the oven for 2 hours at 200 degrees. You guessed it, I made Garlic Confit. Using this just as paste, the flavors were on another level.
                    I could not wait. With a slice of toast, the spread and some cheese I had my first crunch of delicious garlic. I may have jumped the gun but it was time to use the italian bread I had bought earlier that day to its use. 
                    <br> I combined in a blender the garlic confit, butter, parsley, paprika and salt. I spread that on the bread and topped it with mozzarella and parmesan. I put it in the oven for 10 minutes at a broil to quickly melt the cheese.
                    <br> I decided this was not enough. I put on a pot of honey, chiliflakes, salt, hotsauce and a bit of apple cider vinegar to make a delicious hot honey sauce. With a slight drizzle, I was able to elevate this dish immensely. 
                    <br><br>
                    Initially writing this post, I thought it was just another normal day of chores and some studying, but I forgot that even just making bread can be a happy experience. My cholestrol maybe screaming but I am devouring. Until the next food thought!
                    <br>
                    Next goal is to make the bread from scratch. Maybe the mozzerella too. The ultimate cheesy garlic bread!

                <p class="title">Delicious Appetizers, and Gambling for Panama</p>
                <p>
                    Today was the Teq company holiday party. I was not feeling comfortable with what I was wearing so I went and bought a nice button light purple shirt and light brown pants. It was at the Foxhollow. The Cocktail are was in the basement of this venue. I had some appetizers like Brushetta, Cheese and Crackers and other delicious starters. 
                    I had one drink with vodka, cranberry, and pineapple. It was good. I mingled with few people here and there but mostly was focused on the food because I was starving.
                    Soon after, we went upstairs to the main venue. They had a gambling area with games like Blackjack, Poker, Roulette, and Craps. The money was free to play with. However the grand prize for the one with the most money 
                    was a trip to Panama. I thought that was pretty cool. After a small company speech, the games began. I started with Blackjack, where they gave $400 to start with in chips.
                    I stayed a while but eventually lost. Eventually I tried other games like Roulette. I didnt get a chance to play Craps or Poker. I was mostly playing Roulette and Blackjack. 
                    Eventually I played Blackjack again and I won upto $6,900 in fake money. Unfortunately despite it being a good amount, I was not the highest. The highest was approximately $48,000. Craps is the easiest way to make money it seems.
                    I had a great time. I ate some penne a la vodka and roasted potatoes. The party started at 4 and I finished around 8. <br><br>
                    I stopped by glenns because he made muffins. I had a blueberry muffin and it was delicious. I went home, then immediately knocked out.

                <p>
                    Alright. SOOOO its been a bit since I updated this. Last time I did it was the 2nd. I meant to post everyday as a way to look back on things but I got busy and I forgot. Thats Okay. <br>
                    On Monday January 15th Yukta, Joe, Glenn and me went to the city. We ate at a delicious Thai restaurant. I had the Basil Fried Rice with Fried Tofu. Yu had Drunken Noodles with Fried Tofu. Joe had a Shrimp Fried Rice. Finally Glenn had Pad Thai. 
                    We also had several drinks and beers. It was a good time. We were a bit ahead of schedule so we decided to go to the Lego Store nearby the mini golf location.
                    Joe had bought a lego car to build. Finally it was time for Mini Golf. We went to the Swingers Mini Golf. It was a 9 hole course. I got last place lol. Yukta and Joe tied for first and glenn came in second. SOOO technically I was still third place.
                    Soon after we got dollar pizza for yu and me and joe and glenn got Roses pizza. It was a great fun time and I wish we had more time to do things like this.
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>That was the major event over the past 2 weeks. Most of the time I have been working and doing chores at home. Sometimes hanging out at glenns for a brief time. Played No Man Sky for a bit. Thats pretty much the recap for the rest of my days.</p>

                <p>Today was a interesting day. It was my first day back to work. It was a bit tiring but I got throught it. I went to Glenn's after work.
                    With Joe and Glenn we went to go look for couches. We had spent a good amount of time in Raymore and Flanigans. It was interesting to go through
                    but we could not find a couch to meet the requirements. We then went to Ashley's and luckily we found a nice couch that Glenn might decide on later.
                    I decided I am going to make more daily posts as well. Anything significant in my day.

                <p class="title">Happy New Year!</p>
                <p>HAPPY BIRTHDAY! HAPPY NEW YEAR! I am 26 years old now. I am getting old. I am getting closer to 30. I am getting closer to death. I am getting closer to the end. 
                    <br>
                    That is funny. I have a auto suggest and man that auto suggest is dark. This was the first time I got to celebrate my birthday with the stunningly gorgeous Yu. 
                    I got to meet a lot of old friends that I have not seen in ages like Asha and Rithika. I made some new friends as well! This was the first party I decided to go all out.
                    I drank... I am saying 14 shots but it was a mix of vodka, tequila, malt, wine etc. It didn't go as planned as I forgot alcohol toxicity is a thing so I threw up.
                    Luckily I threw it up so I was able to skip being drunk and hung over ~ I was able to enjoy the rest of the night. I really love yu. She took care of me and everyone
                    at this part was so nice and friendly. Did I mention how beautiful she looked?

                    I also got cake and they spread it on my face.

                <p>Today was the first time we hanged out using a fire pit at glenn and phills house. I burned couple sticks and marshmallows.
                    I kebobed a pizza and made it nice and toasty. It was a chill experience. Joe phill and glenn was there. The fire was nice but was not warm enough
                    to fully heat up everywhere. It was great hanging with the boys. Our feet got nice and toasty!
