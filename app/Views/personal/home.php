                <h3>I AM 26!</h3>
                <p class="title">Happy New Year!</p>
                <p>HAPPY BIRTHDAY! HAPPY NEW YEAR! I am 26 years old now. I am getting old. I am getting closer to 30. I am getting closer to death. I am getting closer to the end. 
                    <br>
                    That is funny. I have a auto suggest and man that auto suggest is dark. This was the first time I got to celebrate my birthday with the stunningly gorgeous Yu. 
                    I got to meal a lot of old friends that I have not seen in ages like asha and rithika. I made some new friends as well! This was the first party I decided to go all out.
                    I drank... I am saying 14 shots but it was a mix of vodka, tequila, malt, wine etc. It didn't go as planned as I forgot alcohol toxicity is a thing so I threw up.
                    Luckily I threw it up so I was able to skip being drunk and hung over ~ I was able to enjoy the rest of the night. I really love yu. She took care of me and everyone
                    at this part was so nice and friendly. Did I mention how beautiful she looked? 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I also got cake and they spread it on my face.

                <p class="title">Boys Hangout</p>
                <p>Today was the first time we hanged out using a fire pit at glenn and phills house. I burned couple sticks and marshmallows.
                    I kebobed a pizza and made it nice and toasty. It was a chill experience. Joe phill and glenn was there. The fire was nice but was not warm enough
                    to fully heat up everywhere. It was great hanging with the boys. Our feet got nice and toasty!
