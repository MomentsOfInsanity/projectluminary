                <p>
                    Alright. SOOOO its been a bit since I updated this. Last time I did it was the 2nd. I meant to post everyday as a way to look back on things but I got busy and I forgot. Thats Okay. <br>
                    On Monday January 15th Yukta, Joe, Glenn and me went to the city. We ate at a delicious Thai restaurant. I had the Basil Fried Rice with Fried Tofu. Yu had Drunken Noodles with Fried Tofu. Joe had a Shrimp Fried Rice. Finally Glenn had Pad Thai. 
                    We also had several drinks and beers. It was a good time. We were a bit ahead of schedule so we decided to go to the Lego Store nearby the mini golf location.
                    Joe had bought a lego car to build. Finally it was time for Mini Golf. We went to the Swingers Mini Golf. It was a 9 hole course. I got last place lol. Yukta and Joe tied for first and glenn came in second. SOOO technically I was still third place.
                    Soon after we got dollar pizza for yu and me and joe and glenn got Roses pizza. It was a great fun time and I wish we had more time to do things like this.
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>That was the major event over the past 2 weeks. Most of the time I have been working and doing chores at home. Sometimes hanging out at glenns for a brief time. Played No Man Sky for a bit. Thats pretty much the recap for the rest of my days.</p>

                <p>Today was a interesting day. It was my first day back to work. It was a bit tiring but I got throught it. I went to Glenn's after work.
                    With Joe and Glenn we went to go look for couches. We had spent a good amount of time in Raymore and Flanigans. It was interesting to go through
                    but we could not find a couch to meet the requirements. We then went to Ashley's and luckily we found a nice couch that Glenn might decide on later.
                    I decided I am going to make more daily posts as well. Anything significant in my day.

                <p>HAPPY BIRTHDAY! HAPPY NEW YEAR! I am 26 years old now. I am getting old. I am getting closer to 30. I am getting closer to death. I am getting closer to the end. 
                    <br>
                    That is funny. I have a auto suggest and man that auto suggest is dark. This was the first time I got to celebrate my birthday with the stunningly gorgeous Yu. 
                    I got to meet a lot of old friends that I have not seen in ages like Asha and Rithika. I made some new friends as well! This was the first party I decided to go all out.
                    I drank... I am saying 14 shots but it was a mix of vodka, tequila, malt, wine etc. It didn't go as planned as I forgot alcohol toxicity is a thing so I threw up.
                    Luckily I threw it up so I was able to skip being drunk and hung over ~ I was able to enjoy the rest of the night. I really love yu. She took care of me and everyone
                    at this part was so nice and friendly. Did I mention how beautiful she looked? 
                    <br>

                    I also got cake and they spread it on my face.

                <p>Today was the first time we hanged out using a fire pit at glenn and phills house. I burned couple sticks and marshmallows.
                    I kebobed a pizza and made it nice and toasty. It was a chill experience. Joe phill and glenn was there. The fire was nice but was not warm enough
                    to fully heat up everywhere. It was great hanging with the boys. Our feet got nice and toasty!
