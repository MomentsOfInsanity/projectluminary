                <p>
                    This morning, my mom and me travelled to Queens to meet with a real estate agent. We are trying to sell the house. We showed the agents the house and went back to the office to discuss the details.
                    We werent in Queens long but the whole process still took couple hours with travel and all. On the way back, my mom said we are visiting Pundit. I don't care too much about hanging their but their dog is fun 
                    to play with. I showed a pic of the dog before. I soon went home alone as I had to finish some chores. Mom was going to get dropped off later. I came home and immediately knocked out.
                    I couldn't get much chores done. When I woke up it was 8:30. I only had a limited time to get ready and go get Glenn.

                <h3>Evening Harry Potter</h3>
                <p class="title">Nerdy Bar</p>
                <p>
                    Yukta gave me a warning to not dress up in costume. There was 0% possibility of me going to a Harry Potter event and not me wearing my Hogwarts Legacy cloak. I wore a simple green patterned
                    shirt and the cloak on top. I told Glenn to dress up as well. He wore his red cloak that he got for the Rennisance Faire. I picked him up and we drove to the bar in Farmingdale. 
                    The bar was called the Alibi Lounge. It was a small bar but it was pretty cool. Everything was Harry Potter themed. The drinks, the food, the decor. It was pretty cool. I had a butterbeer float for my
                    my first drink while Glenn drank the HUFFLEPUFF for his first drink. In all fairness I misunderstood what kind of event it would be. I assumed food would be free with the tickets, and maybe their will be some 
                    type of activity like Trivia Night. Maybe talking with other people. I thought it would be a type of social experience. It was not. It was just a bar with a theme. We were very indepentant and we didn't really
                    talk to anyone. 
                    <br><br>
                    We decided to get an appetizer of PRETZEL NUGGETS. I was still hungry so we ordered the Spinach White Pizza. I was still drinking my first drink while Glenn ordered a second drink. 
                    I can't remember the name but the pizza was good for what it was. The food was not a lot and everything was expensive. Glenn eventually ordered a third drink called the FELIX FELICIS. Why am I 
                    capitalizing the names? I don't know but thats how the menu said it. The felix drink was cool as it came in 3 potion bottles, that Glenn had to mix together and it created some type of smokey mixture.
                    The final drink Glenn ordered was the CHOCOLATE FROG. I tried all of them but I personally like Felix the most due to its sweetness. I decided to cover the cost as I invited Glenn and he is always doing things for me. 
                    We got 2 free Butterbeer jugs to take home as souvenirs. I tried to take as many photos and videos as I could. We also got our photos taken as we were leaving.

                    Today is a Friday. I can't remember much of what happened but I did get free tickets to a popup Harry Potter bar event in Farmingdale for Saturday at 10pm. That seemed pretty exciting. I decided to ask 
                    Glenn to go with me as I only had 2. After work, the boys and me went to a restaurant to hang out. I had some fries and a mushroom burger.

                <p class="title">Where does time fly?</p>
                <p>
                    Happy Leap Year! It's been a while since I have written. I wanted to keep up with this daily, but somehow between work, home, life, and everything else in that bundle, its now March 11th. 
                    I feel a bit disappointed in myself. I lost myself a bit in the process. With stress of work, feeling burnt out, and depression, it was hard to keep up with everything. I am going to try to keep up with this.
                    This is another important piece of my life. A diary. A goal. Something to look back on, something to look forward on. Something where I can vocalize my ever changing life. 
                    Another issue is after so long, I can't remember everything as clearly but I will try. <br><br>
                    As for what happened today, I honestly don't remember. I barely texted anyone or did anything. All I have is a picture of my completing my second naruto. I was behind with it only being 3/5th of a mile. 
                    To earn my second Naruto I needed to do 2 miles. I played pokemon while doing the miles.

                    and stopped at Glenn's to drop it off. Glenn sent a text earlier if I wanted to hang out. I guess I haven't seen him fully for few days. I came over, but he and Phill soon went for
                    their run. I played Pokemon in the mean time, and then when they came back I talked a bit more but was feeling even more tired. I went home and knocked out.

                <p>
                    Another normal day at work. Paul had come back from his week long vacation. I was able to do some finishing touches on the feature from friday. Paul had given me a new feature to work on which was group resources.
                    That may not make sense to others reading it but as I am writing this on the 29th, it took a couple days.
                    <br><br>
                    During my lunch break Michael and me finished building our Lego contraption. We built the main set and when you crank it, it flaps its wings. It's pretty cool. We didn't get to finish it again entirely, there was 
                    some decoration flower pieces and a name tag that goes on it. I could have handled this myself as the main part was done. It was pretty fun to do with him.

                    I feel bad for her but it gets on my nerves at times. I drove to Queens, got the mail and then came back home. I was exhausted but Yu and me watched another episode of Avatar.

                    Honestly I don't remember much of these 2 days. Some of it was chores. Some of it was arguing with my mom. It was just a blur of things. Yu and me did end up watching Avatar which was pretty awesome!

                <p class="title">Butterfree with Mike</p>
                <p>
                    Alright, so admittedly I am not writing this on the 23rd but the 29th of February. This should really be something I keep up with daily but sometimes I slack, and it becomes harder as more days past. 
                    Especially if I find it hard to remember things as time passes. The only reason I am able to recollect was by looking at old texts and pictures to remember what I did that day. Today was another work day, 
                    and I finished another feature. This time I built the ability to create demo users for iBlocks Online. I was able to finish it and push it to production. I was pretty happy with it.
                    <br><br>
                    During my lunch break Michael and me had agreed to build Legos together. Honestly, I was going to do it alone during my break as a way to pass the time. However, he seemed interested and so he joined me. 
                    We were building Lego Butterfree which Phill gave me for Secret Santa. Honestly i'm not sure why I am building a lot of legos of late but its a fun activity to pass the time. 
                    As per tradition I set up a timelapse but even with us both working together we could not finish it in one day. There was a bunch of tiny pieces.

                    In the evening I was hanging out with Phill and Glenn. They bullied me to get Thai food. I held strong not wanting to spend money but as time went by, I got hungrier.
                    I eventually caved and said okay but only if they drive to the one place Yu and me likes. I got Tofu Drunken noodles extra spicy. There was one time we had it and it was phenomenal but I never had it the same again.

                <p>
                    Today was another normal day at work. It was bright the cieling lights so Marcello kindly put a diffuser for me. I finished the feature
                    to allow creating demo users for iBlocks Online. Luckily for lunch we got pizza. After work, I stopped by the apple store as I wanted to find out 
                    more possible information on developing for the Vision Pro. I was able to get a bit more information. I need to eventually start studying swift. 
                    I came home, and relaxed but soon I had to help my mom with a possible complaint but it was just ridiculous and old white men being racist. 
                    After work, I did the my mile as usual and then I went to sleep after showering.

                <h3>Moving Day</h3>
                <p class="title">Decorating my new desk</p>
                <p>
                    Today is moving day. We are all moving from downstairs to our desk upstairs. I was excited to finally have a permanent place. When I first started
                    at this company, I was downstairs working with the ex-developer Brian until Paul evenetually wanted me up. I briefly moved up to work with Rich for few months. 
                    Eventually I moved back down to keep Ryan company as he just got hired. Then we both moved upstairs as we got new desks in the dingy little closet. Honestly the privacy was the best there.
                    Then the whole of creative moved downstairs as they were doing construction and remodeling. Finally after all that time, we move back upstairs and settle into our new desks.
                    I wanted to decorate it so I went to Target and bought a plant. It did taking getting used to the new enviroment.
                    <br><br>
                    One interesting thing though... I discovered a new position by Apple. <a href="/assets/media/personal/2024/02February/SpatialWebEngineer.pdf">Spatial Web Engineer.</a> Ever since college, I was always fascinated by AR as a niche. It is difficult though 
                    and expensive to get into and my college didnt have any classes on it. I went into Web Development as that was the next best thing I wouldn't mind doing in life. 
                    However with this new position, it puts a interesting opportunity in my mind. Combining what I already know what to do with web, and what I want to do with Spatial Engineering, this could 
                    be a thing for me. But it will require lots of work and studying in swift and learning. The position may not even exist later on. I will keep trying though cause this 
                    is something I would really love to do. I am going to keep an eye on it and see where it goes.

                    I will have to put the ds down but for now I am happy. Once I finished I pretty much knocked out.

                    A bonus thing that happened today. Theres only 2 streamers I ever only watch. One is a pretty big streamer/youtuber called SmallAnt. The other is oegg_. 
                    Oegg is a small time streamer but his energy and vibes and the same with SmallAnt is what I would want to be like for my own twitch and videos. 
                    I wish Oegg was bigger as he is a really cool guy and he deserves it. To support him I bought a maroon sweatshirt with his logo on it. Its nice and big. 
                    Oegg recognizes me now as I frequent his channel and always comment weekly. I wasn't expecting much after that but I also recieved a video message from him. 
                    He didn't have to do it but it was really nice of him. I am going to keep supporting him and watching him when I can. SmallAnt and him inspires me for my 
                    own content so I hope to keep improving myself.

                    Today was a another normal day of work. I was working on the new demo feature for iBlocks Online. Unfortunately my moms vaccuum blew so I needed to go buy another one.
                    I stopped by Glenn's to eat a piece of cheesecake brownie which was delicious. I asked if he wanted to join for company to talk because I was bored. Most of the time he 
                    says no but this time he said yes. After getting a new vaccuum, I came home and fixed the vaccuum. I was so tired I practically knocked out for a bit. I woke up and ate some 
                    rice and daal while on call with Yukta. Then I knocked out again.

                    and knocked out on Glenns couch for 2 hours. It's a funny trend as Glenn will always take a picture to send to my girlfriend. After the shopping I pushed and did the final 
                    mile and earned my final mile to get a naruto. This would be Naruto Vol 17. This is the first time I did 5 miles in a month. I am really proud of myself.

                    This morning I had to wake up and do the dishes. During the dishes, my mom made Pav Bhaji. It was pretty good. I never liked vegetables growing up but I always loved Pav Bhaji. 
                    Its a good way to be able to eat a bunch of vegetables. We used burger buns as getting traditional pav isn't always the easiest. After the food, I went for another run. I am 
                    feeling better about it. I am not the best with consistency but its starting to get easier. I am now 4/5th of a Naruto done. I am going to keep increasing the pace each time. 
                    After the run I spent most of the day relaxing and doing light work as I was so exhausted from the rest of the week.

                    we came home and I knocked out for a bit for a nap. I eventually woke up and spent couple hours with Yu on call just hanging out. It was nice to spend time with her.

                    I was exhausted but I pushed through and did another mile of running. I am now 3/5ths of a Naruto. Its getting easier. I put the pace to 2.1 to get it under 30 minutes. I will keep slowly increasing the pace.
                    Soon after, I should have showered but I knocked out.

                <h3>Lovers Legos and Lasers</h3>
                <p class="title">A fun Valentines</p>
                <p>
                    Another year, another Valentines. I took a half day today, and Yukta was going to come around 12:30 PM. Today was also the water inspection. She had just come back from her New Orleans trip as well.
                    We stopped at Cheesecake Factory and had some Nachos. Even with the two of us, we could not finish them. The factory is intense. To digest we decided to walk the mall a little bit as its not a very large mall.
                    On the way we passed through the Apple Store. Yukta mentioned about the Vision Pro. I totally forgot about it's existence and practically dragged her to the store. By lucky chance 
                    we both got the chance to demo it. It was one of the coolest things I had did in my life. I wish I can do more with it. It is super expensive costing around 4k. Part of me wants to get it and leave it in storage for 20 years.
                    <br><br>
                    After the demo, we took a break and then eventually played Legos in Panera. We had a lot of fun. This was Yu's first time building Legos. We built 2 Roses, and 2 Sunflowers. 
                    After Legos we went to Dirty Tacos and had some bomb ass fries and tacos. Unfortunately soon after we had to split away and head home. I wish I can spend more time with her. 
                    I am going to write a more detailed post on our personal site. I'll post the link right there when it's done.

                <p>
                    For the first time in a long time, I was able to work from home. I was able to sleep in more and relax a bit. I was able to catch 
                    up on some home work. For most of the day I was remote-working but then I eventually did the snow shoveling. It was the largest snow we had in many years.
                    That was the hardest part of the day. I really need to get a snow blower. It becomes even worse when snow turns to Ice. The next days the snow freezed up.
                    I wish I was able to work from home more often. It makes managing the home things easier. I don't have to worry about the commute or eating out but I do like the interactions. I wouldn't mind if it was hybrid some days.

                    Later in the night I did another mile of inclined walking. Glenn was right that playing the ds while I walk makes it much easier and less boring but I 
                    need to increase my pace as I was not breaking too much of a sweat until the end. Consistency is key though! 2/5 miles is done till I get a free Naruto book.
                    Soon after I showered then passed out.

                    Today was a interesting day. I had slept in due to being exhausted from yesterdays work. I needed to get some groceries but before I did I asked the guys if they wanted to do bagels. 
                    Since I asked, per tradition I payed for it. I got a veggie creamcheese on a egg everything bagel. It was pretty good. I did the grocery shopping and came home. For most of the day I was 
                    just relaxing and playing Pokemon Black. In the evening I went to the twins house, and I watched Battle Bots with Glenn, Joe, and Tori for a bit. It was the quarter-final It was pretty cool. I had a good time.
                    My friends aren't the type of people to care about sports like football. Today was the Superbowl. I don't care either but everyone in work does so I only have a passive interest in it.

                <p class="title">So much room for activities</p>
                <p>
                    So I had plans to clean the basement for a while especially after more recently making a mess of it again while trying to find things. My mom has zero patience and doesn't see 
                    I work 5 days a week and I am tired. I had to do it today as a guy will come Wednesday for a Water Inspection. Honestly, I spent most of the day taking everything I dumped on the floor 
                    and bringing it to the den. Most of it was garbage or things we did not need or used. It look me a better part of 12 hours with breaks in between but I was able to do it in waves. The energy came and went.
                    Towards the last 2 hours I was really pushing myself. I asked glenn to come and help me finish the last part of dumping the stuff from the den to the trash. 
                    I asked him to get pizza as I was busy all day. I gobbled several slices as I did not eat anything all day except breakfast. I wanted a deserved reward and man was it deserving. I venmoed glenn for the pizza and a bit extra for helping me 
                    with house work again. He's a good friend. Yu and her friends were soon leaving to New Orleans for few days. I hope she has a fun trip.
                    <br><br>
                    During the breaks I finally finished the main story of Firered. There is a post game which I will do later. I was slightly underleveled so the Elite Four
                    and Champion was challenging but it was fun till the end. I started Black, but they changed the naming conventions. Gen 3 had all names and Pokemon all CAPS. Gen 5 has 
                    stardardized names like Red. I am debating whether to rename all my gen 3 pokemon or not. I am leaning towards not but it definitely looks weird in the newer games.
                    <br><br> P.S: A good way to declutter stuff is just dump it on the floor. Its very effective when deciding what to keep or not.

                    Today was another normal day at work. After work I picked up the weekly yogurt for the twins mom. I actually saw them near their house on their run. 
                    After dropping the yogurt I went towards my house and I saw them again coming back. I pulled over thinking they would stop and say hi for a minute. They 
                    said hi but ran past instead of stopping. I was like bruh that was a bit rude but I wasn't actually upset. I thought it was funny. Glenn said they were trying to 
                    keep within their time later on. I was having a craving to make something again. I decided to make Spinach Pasta as I did not want the Spinach I bought to go to waste.
                    <br><br>
                    I put the pasta to boil with some salt. In another pot, I cooked some garlic and chili flakes in some oil till it was fragant and put the spinach leaves in. Before the pasta was done,
                    I put some salt, cream cheese, and some pasta water into the spinach. I mixed it all together and let it cook for a bit. I then put the pasta in and mixed it all together. I put some parmesan cheese to top it off.
                    <br> It was really delicious!

                    Honestly, I am writing this nearly a week after. That was my fault. I got busy and I thought hey I'll just do it later. Its not as easy to update this
                    from the phone. I should learn to take notes however for the day as it was getting hard to remember what I had done. Thats why I started this journal. I felt like I can't remember as much anymore and wanted to remember
                    the little moments.
                    <br><br>
                    Today was a normal work day, pretty busy. Since its been a week I can't remember what I did at work but it was busy. I was tired post work so I came home and napped for about 2 hours. This 
                    worked out well as I know had enough energy to help Yu study for her upcoming PA school interview. I always love spending time with her even if it is just studying. 
                    I was also playing Pokemon Firered as it was a easy game I don't need to think about too much.

                <p>
                    There was a issue we had been trying to deal with for a while. The app would dramatically slow down when there was 30 something students using the application for the first time.
                    It would practically break the site. We had 3 developers inlcuding myself and the i.t team trying to figure this out. Eventually we came to the conclusion that it had to do with session data.
                    We were not garbage collecting which added up over time to 2.5 million rows of data. Deleting the records sped everything up and we put in place to delete old session data once it has been expired.
                    It is just one of those things that we have to figure out as there was not much we could test with. I do feel bad for the schools who is our guinea pigs in a sense since this app is in early stages of public release.
                    Hopefully future issues will be smooth sailing.

                <p class="title">It's Glenns fault</p>
                <p>
                    Glenn in the middle of the day sent me a picture of a smoked gouda and red pepper dip. My mind went wild with the possibilities. It was all I could think about. How to make a delicious meal with this. 
                    I finished work and stopped by Meat Farms. I got Smoked Gouda which was delicious, some muenster cheese, spinach leaves, red bell peppers and white bread. I had decide I was gonna make the spread from scratch.
                    I had cooked some simple stirfry for my mom and myself. Around 8 is when I decided to make my dish. I roasted the red peppers and put it in a blender with garlic and dhaniya. 
                    I usually do this when making a khadi mix figured a replacement of green chilies to red peppers would be good. Honestly I may have got the quanties off as I never cooked with red bell paper. The spread by itself wasn't something I would just eat spoonfuls off.
                    I had to make a decision to continue forward or give up and try something else. I decided its a experiment to continue forward. 
                    <br><br>
                    I decided to lay 2 pieces of bread, but 2 slices of gouda on each, 1 slice of muenster, some spinach leaves and a spoonful of the spread. I am making a grilled cheese. Though I have this nice little press so technically its a panini grilled cheese.
                    With mayo on both sides of the bread, and button on the press, I had finally gotten my panini grilled cheese. One side was a bit darker but not a big deal. Otherwise perfectly golden. 
                    I wish I took a picture. I had invited glenn over because he contributed to the idea and I didn't want a whole grilled cheese. I had half and he had half. He is basically my guinea pig when I feel inspired to cook.
                    <br><br>
                    It was... honestly delicious. Everything went together really well, more then I thought it would. I might do the red bell peppers a bit differently next time, but in the sandwich it worked really well. 
                    <br><br>
                    After Glenn left, I loafed for another hour, finished the dishes and threw the garbage. I should have finished earlier but due to my laziness I wasn't able to work out.

                <p>
                    Today mom and me went to Queens, to show a potential buyer for the house. We gave the basement and firstfloor some bug traps. It's not a big deal to go to Queens but it does 
                    take a portion of the day. After we stopped by the Gurdwara to pray and eat langar. After that, we went and stopped by Pundits. I mostly played with the Dog. We weren't there for long.

                   It has been some time since I got to properly talk with Yu. We caught up over the last few days. Saturday was Asthas 18th birthday. We mostly hanged on call. I decided to test 
                   the Gameboy machine by epilogue. It allows me to play gameboy games on the computer. Honestly it was pretty awesome. It has a lot of potential. I mostly gave Yu company as she did her work. I 
                   forgot to mention I also worked out again before the call with Yu for the first time in a long time. I did a 40 minute walk at 1.5 speed to get 1 mile at a 10% incline. I also had pizza prior to the work out 
                   so atleast I burnt off what I put in.

                <p class="title">Succulents Timelapse</p>
                <p>
                    Alright, today is a fun day to talk about. I had a normal day at work. During lunch I played more Firered. I also got a haircut right afterwork. <br>
                    Around 7PM, the guys and I got pizza at Glenns. I had couple plain slices. Glenn had a box of 3 in 1 lego succulents. It's been a while since we were able to do a group activity together.
                    I decided it would be fun to timelapse it all. Phill and Glenn worked together on a set. Joe worked on his and I worked on mine. Glenn and Phill have been playing with legos for years.
                    I never got into it finding it to cumbersome. However, over the last several years after being gifted seevral legos, I got Espeon and Umbreon from Yu. I got Snorlax from Joe. I got lego spiderman
                    from a christmas white elephant party. I got Butterfree, and the Kanto starters with Pikachu from Phill for our Secret Santa. I think its the universe telling me to play with legos. <br>
                    <br> Glenn and Phill finished pretty early. Phill then came and helped me as I had multiple pieces. Joe took a bit of time. No hates towards the man but man cannot talk and build at the same time. I 
                    say that with all the love lol. It's okay I did not mind it. We were all chilling. Post legos glenn was knitting. Phill was hanging around and I started to play my game until Joe was done.
                    <br> I had a great time. I am glad we were able to do this. I hope we can do more things like this. The timelapse is honestly pretty funny. Check it out!

                    Its another day, but its February. Where did the time go seriously? I have been so busy with work and life that I have not been able to do much. I have been playing Pokemon Firered.
                    I played some XD: Gale of Darkness. I have been doing chores non stop on weekends. It feels like I dont always get to do much. Thats why I started on this daily blog. Its to show myself the little things along
                    the way. The important things we tend to forget but are still hugely part of our days. Today was another day of work. I finished it and was back home. I have 
                    been playing Firered during my lunch breaks and post work.

                    Another day of work, I finished building the district and school features to add teachers and classes.
                    I also built the search user and spoof capabilities. I cant remember if it was Wednesday or Tuesday but I started Pokemon Firered <br> After work, I picked up the yogurt and went to Phills. I hanged out with phill for a bit. Since he is moving soon, he was going through things to sell and we were talking of the future.
                    Its been a minute of us hanging 1 on 1 as we are both busy with our lives. I was able to get some neat stuff like 4k UHD blu-ray player, and a original gameboy. I came home finished the second season of the bear and eventually slept after eating rice kichadi.

                    Today was a normal day at work. I finished building another feature into iBlocks Online. I can't remember much but just been banging out these features. Been busy with a lot of tasks. <br>
                    After work, I went home and played more Twitch. However in the night, issues started to arise in Queens House. Basement was leaking from the cieling a lot, and the second floor had a case of bed bugs. This stressed me out with anixety.
                    I kept playing but it did not make me feel better as I was not in the mood. It felt forced.

                <p class="title">Good eats</p>
                <p>
                    Today was a interesting day. I tried to cut back on chores today due to being sore yesterday. I did some light stuff. Today was a day of good food. <br>
                    In the morning my mom made Chole and Puri. I had 3 puris with the chole. For the evening, my mom made Pakodas. We made paneer, onion, chili and bread pakodas.
                    I wasn't too much of a fan of chile pakodas but the onion paneer and bread pakodas slapped. The bread pakodas was made with taking leftover aloo stuffing into a sandwich and 
                    coating the bread and frying it. I was in food heaven today. I never liked pakodas growing up but I have grown to like it of recent years. Especially after my last trip to India.
                    <br> However I feel my mom still makes the batter a bit thick and floury. Need to figure out how to have the same crisp but less thickness. Because of the thickness, if 
                    it is not eaten fresh it can get soggy afterwards. 
                </p>
                <p class="title">Pokemon Fever</p>
                <p>
                    As mentioned from my Saturday post I have started recording again. I am playing Pokemon XD: Gale of Darkness. I am trying to complete a challenge by the date of April 8th. But more realistically April 1st as I need a buffer. <br>
                    The challenge is pretty simple. On April 8th, is when Pokemon will shut down online services for several 3ds games and soon after Pokemon Bank. Pokemon has the unique
                    ability to transfer all your pokemon from older games to the newer games. So theoretically I can transfer pokemon from gen 3 to the current games. They have gen 1-2 as virtual games,
                    but as gen 3 games have remaster versions and the fact I never played original gen 1-2 for example Red, but played FireRed I decided to do it this way. <br>
                    The games I will be playing for the challenge are Pokemon Colosseum which is already completed, Pokemon XD: Gale of Darkness, Pokemon FireRed,
                    Pokemon Emerald, Pokemon Platinum, Pokemon Heartgold, Pokemon Black, Pokemon Black 2, Pokemon X or Y, Pokemon Alpha Sapphire, Pokemon Sun, and Pokemon Ultra Moon. <br>
                    Yea. I know it's a lot. I only have 2 months. I should have started atleast the first 4 games earlier. It is not the easiest to get moving and do. With a hard deadline its now or never.
                    I want to be able to play these games and transfer all my friends up to the modern games. While I can still have them on the older games. It would be so cool for everything I have collected.
                    <br><br>
                    Paragraph aside, I spent a bit of time trying to figure out how to stream and record. The last time I did this I wasnt able to do things properly. With a bit more research,
                    I reset OBS and start again. I got a good setup going this time. I feel more motivated to record and stream now then ever. Just have to keep up with the deadline. I finished upto episode 6.

                <p class="title">Chores, Movies and Games</p>
                <p>
                    Saturday morning. As typical with most of my Saturdays, it begins with doing chores due to me being busy over the week. <br>
                    I threw all the pots from the backyard, as well as the table and any broken stuff. I also blew the backyard parking lot with a leaf blower to make it look neat. 
                    I also did the dishes and the laundry. There was few other things I did but I can't remember now. This was my day throughout. <br><br>
                    For breakfast/lunch my mom made Aloo Parathas. I had 2 of them. They were delicious. I also had a cup of chai. Aloo Parathas are one of my favoite dishes. While we ate, 
                    we started a movie called Udaan. Honestly it was pretty good. It wasn't a typical bollywood movie. It was more of a drama. I liked it. <br><br>
                    In the night, I had cleaned up my room and started the setup for recording my games once again. I had gotten it mostly right but was having some minor issues with it. 
                    The game sound was not coming out of my headphones which it usually did. I eventually figured out it had to do with the mic not being assigned so my bluetooth headphones kept
                    tripping up OBS due to it being a mic and headphone 2 in 1 but OBS can only recognize one at a time. I played for a brief time only finishing the first episode.

                    After work, I went home for a short bit, then went to Glenns. We celebrated Tori's birthday with some cake. After the birthday, Joe had come and along with Tori and her boyfriend we went bowling. Unfortunately what 
                    none of us realized was that it was league night so we waited in the car for a bit and another bit longer at the bar. I got a drink cocktail. Honestly I didn't like it. Glenn ordered a beer, but he got lucky and got a double because they
                    didn't have the smaller glasses available. Due to the time, I however had to leave early and could not bowl. I went home and knocked out. I was so tired. Working takes a lot out of me.

                <p>
                    Today was a normal day at work. Though I think I made my boss happy as he gave me a $50 amazon gift card as a bonus. I used the gift card to buy 5 more naruto mangas. <br>
                    I realized I have not bought any of my naruto manga. It has either been given as a gift or bought through gift cards that I got from work. Yes it is buying something but its practically free money.
                    <br><br>
                    After work, as per usual I picked up the yogurt for Glenns Mom. I went home and watched The Bear. I had finished Season 1. It's a really good show. Glenn offered to buy me naruto manga if i do more exercise. That would be so funny but considering it. I need to get back into shape.

                    Once again it's a Monday. Another day of work. I figured I would do something nicer today and dress up more better for work. I felt good about myself. It is a lot of effort though to wake up in the morning to iron clothes.
                    Maybe I should do this at night and have the clothes ready. For lunch I went to Just Salads and got a spinach bowl with raisans, picklen onions, roasted corn, and crotons. As my protein i chose the impossible chicken. It's 
                    not bad but does have weird text intially. <br><br>
                    For the evening, Glenn was not happy with peruvian food and wanted a redemption so we got thai food. This time I got the Tofu Drunken Noodles Extra Spicy. We went to a place Phill recommended. It tastes good,
                    but I wanted more noodles then vegetables. I played some no man sky at home and that was pretty much my day.

                <h3>Chores and food</h3>
                <p class="title">The hunt for flavors.</p>
                <p>
                    Today was mostly a day dedicated to chores. I did the dishes, and grocery. However, through the day I was having one of those mood cravings to cook. It is all I will think about all day.
                    A specific thing actually, Cheesy Garlic Bread. My Cholestrol is screaming but I must have it. I made Garlic Bread before, many times but never like this. Instead of mashing garlic and butter together, I wanted to elevate the garlic.
                    <br> I had put several garlic cloves with a covering of olive oil and put that in the oven for 2 hours at 200 degrees. You guessed it, I made Garlic Confit. Using this just as paste, the flavors were on another level.
                    I could not wait. With a slice of toast, the spread and some cheese I had my first crunch of delicious garlic. I may have jumped the gun but it was time to use the italian bread I had bought earlier that day to its use. 
                    <br> I combined in a blender the garlic confit, butter, parsley, paprika and salt. I spread that on the bread and topped it with mozzarella and parmesan. I put it in the oven for 10 minutes at a broil to quickly melt the cheese.
                    <br> I decided this was not enough. I put on a pot of honey, chiliflakes, salt, hotsauce and a bit of apple cider vinegar to make a delicious hot honey sauce. With a slight drizzle, I was able to elevate this dish immensely. 
                    <br><br>
                    Initially writing this post, I thought it was just another normal day of chores and some studying, but I forgot that even just making bread can be a happy experience. My cholestrol maybe screaming but I am devouring. Until the next food thought!
                    <br>
                    Next goal is to make the bread from scratch. Maybe the mozzerella too. The ultimate cheesy garlic bread!

                <h3>Company Party at the Foxhollow</h3>
                <p class="title">Delicious Appetizers, and Gambling for Panama</p>
                <p>
                    Today was the Teq company holiday party. I was not feeling comfortable with what I was wearing so I went and bought a nice button light purple shirt and light brown pants. It was at the Foxhollow. The Cocktail are was in the basement of this venue. I had some appetizers like Brushetta, Cheese and Crackers and other delicious starters. 
                    I had one drink with vodka, cranberry, and pineapple. It was good. I mingled with few people here and there but mostly was focused on the food because I was starving.
                    Soon after, we went upstairs to the main venue. They had a gambling area with games like Blackjack, Poker, Roulette, and Craps. The money was free to play with. However the grand prize for the one with the most money 
                    was a trip to Panama. I thought that was pretty cool. After a small company speech, the games began. I started with Blackjack, where they gave $400 to start with in chips.
                    I stayed a while but eventually lost. Eventually I tried other games like Roulette. I didnt get a chance to play Craps or Poker. I was mostly playing Roulette and Blackjack. 
                    Eventually I played Blackjack again and I won upto $6,900 in fake money. Unfortunately despite it being a good amount, I was not the highest. The highest was approximately $48,000. Craps is the easiest way to make money it seems.
                    I had a great time. I ate some penne a la vodka and roasted potatoes. The party started at 4 and I finished around 8. <br><br>
                    I stopped by glenns because he made muffins. I had a blueberry muffin and it was delicious. I went home, then immediately knocked out.

                    Alright. SOOOO its been a bit since I updated this. Last time I did it was the 2nd. I meant to post everyday as a way to look back on things but I got busy and I forgot. Thats Okay. <br>
                    On Monday January 15th Yukta, Joe, Glenn and me went to the city. We ate at a delicious Thai restaurant. I had the Basil Fried Rice with Fried Tofu. Yu had Drunken Noodles with Fried Tofu. Joe had a Shrimp Fried Rice. Finally Glenn had Pad Thai. 
                    We also had several drinks and beers. It was a good time. We were a bit ahead of schedule so we decided to go to the Lego Store nearby the mini golf location.
                    Joe had bought a lego car to build. Finally it was time for Mini Golf. We went to the Swingers Mini Golf. It was a 9 hole course. I got last place lol. Yukta and Joe tied for first and glenn came in second. SOOO technically I was still third place.
                    Soon after we got dollar pizza for yu and me and joe and glenn got Roses pizza. It was a great fun time and I wish we had more time to do things like this.
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>That was the major event over the past 2 weeks. Most of the time I have been working and doing chores at home. Sometimes hanging out at glenns for a brief time. Played No Man Sky for a bit. Thats pretty much the recap for the rest of my days.</p>

                    With Joe and Glenn we went to go look for couches. We had spent a good amount of time in Raymore and Flanigans. It was interesting to go through
                    but we could not find a couch to meet the requirements. We then went to Ashley's and luckily we found a nice couch that Glenn might decide on later.
                    I decided I am going to make more daily posts as well. Anything significant in my day.

                    That is funny. I have a auto suggest and man that auto suggest is dark. This was the first time I got to celebrate my birthday with the stunningly gorgeous Yu. 
                    I got to meet a lot of old friends that I have not seen in ages like Asha and Rithika. I made some new friends as well! This was the first party I decided to go all out.
                    I drank... I am saying 14 shots but it was a mix of vodka, tequila, malt, wine etc. It didn't go as planned as I forgot alcohol toxicity is a thing so I threw up.
                    Luckily I threw it up so I was able to skip being drunk and hung over ~ I was able to enjoy the rest of the night. I really love yu. She took care of me and everyone
                    at this part was so nice and friendly. Did I mention how beautiful she looked?

                <h3>Hanging Out With...</h3>
                <p class="title">Boys Hangout</p>
                <p>Today was the first time we hanged out using a fire pit at glenn and phills house. I burned couple sticks and marshmallows.
                    I kebobed a pizza and made it nice and toasty. It was a chill experience. Joe phill and glenn was there. The fire was nice but was not warm enough
                    to fully heat up everywhere. It was great hanging with the boys. Our feet got nice and toasty!
